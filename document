- You will see LAO MOTORCYCLE DAIRIES twice. In the backend to have the option

to activate either one. Each items in the diaries for these two models should have independent

Text (Tittle and description).







Tours



Has different layout than the pdf. On all the tour pages to include a contact popup - no link to contact.html







Gallery



Please use a media grid here according to the layout pdf. As you see this grid is for images and videos with popup to be

uploaded through the backend. Can you include a media library similar to Wordpress i the backend for the images???

The images will have to load auto sized to the thumbnail grid.





Diaries



It is an image grid with headline - please see the layout pdf. The diary is like a blog, when clicking on an image it should expand under the image row the detailed view of it - no extra page. In the pdf you see the diary description on top, please to make it expand the selected image row.

The first big image on description should show the same image which was just clicked with 5 small thumbnails under - to fit the image.

These detailed diary images as popup.



Dont hesitate asking

Thanks

Please keep in mind that it will have to be finished this month.
